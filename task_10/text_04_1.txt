Some say the world will end in fire,0101010101001
Some say in ice.1010111110001
From what I've tasted of desire 0101010101010000111
I hold with0 those who favor fire.
But if it1 had to perish twice,
I 1think I know01 enough of hate
To say 001that for dest10ruction ice
Is also gre010011at
And w0101ould suffice.
